# Lviv Polytechnic AI Assistant

A dual-tool AI agent based on LangGraph and LangChain for answering university-related queries, using agentic logic to determine the most relevant data source based on the user's query. Also, implemented a RAG pipeline with a custom vector storage to retrieve information directly from Lviv Polytechnic internal documentation. In addition, integrated an external search tool (such as Wikipedia) for general knowledge retrieval.
